# Simple Pong game

Everything that can be hardcoded is hardcoded.

Tested on pygame 2.1.2 and python 3.10.9

```
pip install pygame
python -m pong
```

press space to disable/enable AI (on the right)

`w/s` (or `,/o`) for left paddle up/down movement
`up/down` for right paddle up/down movement (when AI is disabled)

AI is dumb, yeah
